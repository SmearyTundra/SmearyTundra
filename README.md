## Projects
* [`Nonparametric Analysis of US Dairy Production and Consumption`](https://github.com/SmearyTundra/nonparametric-analysis-US-dairy-production-consumption) : Analysis of US Dairy Market dynamics from 1985 to 2021. Developed models using nonparametric statistical methods such as GAMs, bootstrap, conformal prediction, spatial analysis and Bayesian clustering to identify best operating areas, pricing strategy and trending products.
* [`Stochastic Block Model Prior with Ordering Constraints for Gaussian Graphical Models`](https://github.com/SmearyTundra/bayesian-statistics-project) : Developed a Gibbs Sampler from scratch. In a Bayesian framework, a flexible new prior for Gaussian Graphical Models is proposed to allow learning a conditional dependence (block) structure among variables, taking into account ordering constraints.
* [`Development of a wearable fall detection system using Machine Learning`](https://github.com/SmearyTundra/slhd-challenge) : Developed a classification system to distinguish activities of daily living (running, walking, falling...) using accelerometer data, employing machine learning models and time series feature extraction. Developed in python.
* [`Estimating Client's Needs using Machine Learning`](https://github.com/SmearyTundra/Fintech-Project) : Exploited machine learning techniques to create a cross-platform web-app to recommend products based on clients' needs.
* [`Study Plan Maker`](https://github.com/SmearyTundra/Study-Plan-Maker) : Web-app to generate optimal study plans based on student's preferences using linear programming.
