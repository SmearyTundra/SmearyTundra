## Projects
* [`Nonparametric Analysis of US Dairy Production and Consumption`](https://github.com/SmearyTundra/nonparametric-analysis-US-dairy-production-consumption) : Analysis of US Dairy Market dynamics from 1985 to 2021. Developed models using nonparametric statistical methods such as GAMs, bootstrap, conformal prediction, spatial analysis and Bayesian clustering to identify best operating areas, pricing strategy and trending products.
* [`Stochastic Block Model Prior with Ordering Constraints for Gaussian Graphical Models`](https://github.com/SmearyTundra/bayesian-statistics-project) : Developed a Gibbs Sampler from scratch. In a Bayesian framework, a flexible new prior for Gaussian Graphical Models is proposed to allow learning a conditional dependence (block) structure among variables, taking into account ordering constraints.
* [`Multi-center study for Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma`]() : Developed classification models, clustering, and generalized linear mixed model using R.
Implemented survival models: Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox models, and patients stratification by risk.
Analyzed the impact of adding radiomics features extracted from CT data to demographical data in statistical models.
* [`Estimating Client's Needs using Machine Learning`](https://github.com/SmearyTundra/Fintech-Project) : Exploited machine learning techniques to create a cross-platform web-app to recommend products based on clients' needs.
